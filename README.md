## 🔹 Run Locally

Follow these steps to run Smart Note on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaralrubaie/-smart-meeting-notes-by-LLM-.git
   cd smart_note
```
2. Install dependencies:
 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🔹 Limitations

- Summarization may take longer for longer or complex texts.  
- Running the model locally may be slow if your computer lacks a powerful GPU or sufficient memory.  
- This project uses the pretrained model for **inference only**; training large models locally is resource-intensive and not supported.  
- When using the live app on Hugging Face Spaces, inference time may also be affected by **server load** and **internet speed**.
